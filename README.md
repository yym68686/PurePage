# PurePage

Welcome to PurePage!

PurePage is a minimalist blog page that is completely based on Github Page and uses Github's own GitHub Flavored Markdown to render article content, allowing you to focus on writing without worrying about complex blog system setup and maintenance. With a focus on localization and data autonomy, PurePage ensures that your content is under your control.

I developed PurePage because I had tried many different blog systems, such as Hexo, Docusaurus 2, and Notion, but always found them too complicated and difficult to use. Therefore, I came up with the idea of using Github Page to create a simple blog page, making writing easier and more relaxed.

The feature of PurePage is that it is very simple, with no excessive settings and complex functions, only a simple search function and an automatically generated article list. At the same time, the rendering effect of PurePage is very good, using Github's own GitHub Flavored Markdown to render article content, making your articles look more beautiful and professional.

If you are a minimalist blogger looking for a simple and efficient blog page that puts data autonomy and localization at the forefront, then PurePage is definitely a good choice. Please feel free to try it out and welcome any feedback and suggestions.
